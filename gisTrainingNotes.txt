	# How many GIS people do we have?
	  100's 
	  50-ish that  may use some of this

# Goals: Provide a training path for GIS Specialists 
	 to gain relevant-to-them developer essentials.

	# Long term:
	 - Tools for collaborating (open source)
	 - Skills to publish user friendly, reusable, reliable code.
	 - Reduce the amount of wheel reinventing
	 - Reduce bureaucracy in finding existing solutions

	 - Short term
